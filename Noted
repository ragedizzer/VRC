Most mech stories are power fantasies, spectacles without emotional stakes. I grew up loving them, but the only ones that stayed with me were the rare few where the mechs framed something human. Smoke and Hearts exist to finally deliver the thing this genre has always avoided: a deeply personal, romantic coming-of-age story where ambition and desire collide in ways that feel painfully real.
Abi and Cat are two young people in love, trapped in a system that rewards him for every choice that breaks her. The reader roots for Abi as the underdog, celebrates his rise… only to slowly realize they’ve been cheering for the very machinery that crushes the person who loves him most. A mech story where victory doesn’t save you and where getting everything you desire means losing what you truly need. 
Readers will fall in love with Abi’s underdog rise, celebrate his opportunities, and feel the thrill of watching him prove himself. But as the story turns, they will feel they may have never felt reading before: complicity. The realization that their support helped push him toward a future he never truly wanted and away from the girl who did. 
Smoke and Hearts is built to resonate long after the final page because it speaks to a universal experience: that ambition and love don’t always coexist and that the world often cheers for the wrong victory. Instead of reinforcing the familiar YA message that “success earns happiness,” this story challenges readers to confront the emotional cost of chasing what everyone else tells you to want.
This story becomes more than entertainment, it’s the kind of story that  parents, family, friends and librarians’  will recommend for generations, saying how it changed them the first time they read it. 

























WHY THIS STORY NEEDS TO EXIST

I grew up loving mech comics, but they rarely left a lasting impact; beneath all the spectacle, most were variations on the same power fantasy—teen boy proves himself, earns the respect of bullies, wins the girl, becomes a hero. The only mech stories that stuck with me were the ones where the machines framed something human: the messy romances of Robotech, or the quiet personal ache of Aim for the Top. I learned that what lingers isn’t the engineering—it’s the emotional truth. And yet, most mech stories overlook that, especially for young women, who only connect when the narrative centers real relationships, as with Evangelion. The mech genre has never truly explored romance and ambition with the honesty that defines the YA books that shaped generations.

Smoke and Hearts is my attempt to give the mech genre what it’s always lacked: a story where the battles matter because the hearts inside the machines do. It begins with what YA readers crave—desire, longing, the electric danger of falling for someone you shouldn’t—and then it asks the question so many coming-of-age stories avoid: What if the person you love is the person the world needs you to defeat? Abi isn’t the best pilot. Cat isn’t the “right” rival. Their story isn’t about triumph—it’s about the impossible choice between ambition and the human need to be loved.

And then the twist: the reader roots for Abi the way the world does. They want him to get opportunities, rise as the underdog, gain advantages that feel earned. But with every reward he receives, Cat pays the cost. The reader cheers him on even as they begin to see—too late—that they’ve supported a system that crushes the girl who loves him, and pushes Abi toward a victory that destroys him inside. When he finally becomes the people’s champion, the world calls him a hero… but the reader sees the truth: he has achieved his desire and lost his need.

Smoke and Hearts matters because it shows young readers—and the adults they’ll become—something real:
Sometimes the world will reward you for the choices that quietly break you.
Sometimes success costs the thing that makes you human.
And in that quiet realization, this story becomes more than entertainment—it becomes the kind of book people hand to their own kids one day, saying, “This one changed me. This one stays with you.”



Here are two deliverables, clean and pitch-ready:

1. TIGHT, PUNCHY VERSION (for the pitch document)

Most mech stories are power fantasies—spectacle without emotional stakes. I grew up loving them, but the only ones that stayed with me were the rare few where the mechs framed something human. Smoke and Hearts exists to finally deliver the thing this genre has always avoided: a deeply personal, romantic coming-of-age story where ambition and desire collide in ways that feel painfully real.

Abi and Cat aren’t hero and obstacle—they’re two young people in love, trapped in a system that rewards him for every choice that breaks her. The reader roots for Abi as the underdog, celebrates his rise… only to slowly realize they’ve been cheering for the very machinery that crushes the person who loves him most.

This is a mech story where victory doesn’t save you—where becoming the champion means losing what you truly need. Smoke and Hearts speaks to the truth young readers recognize long before adults admit it: sometimes the world will applaud you for the choices that quietly ruin you.

2. WHY THIS STORY WILL LEAVE A MARK (expanded impact section)

Smoke and Hearts is built to resonate long after the final page because it speaks to a universal experience: the moment young people learn that ambition and love don’t always coexist—and that the world often cheers for the wrong victory. Instead of reinforcing the familiar YA message that “success earns happiness,” this story challenges readers to confront the emotional cost of chasing what everyone else tells you to want.

Readers will fall in love with Abi’s underdog rise, celebrate his opportunities, and feel the thrill of watching him prove himself. But as the story turns, they will feel something rarer: complicity. The realization that their support helped push him toward a future he never truly wanted—and away from the girl who did. That tension forces a deeper, more reflective engagement than typical hero narratives offer.

Young readers will see themselves in Abi’s conflicted climb. Older readers will recognize the ghost of choices they made at that age. And both will come away with a lasting question: Was the dream worth the pieces of yourself you traded for it?

It’s the kind of emotional reckoning that becomes generational—
a story teenagers hold close, and adults one day pass to their children saying,
“This book changed how I saw myself. Read this.”
