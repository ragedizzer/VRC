We all enter and wait in a circle until we all arrive and are ID if 18+. 

**Exiting a World**
We all leave the area where we were and find somewhere private. Talk for up to a few minutes, to give any stragglers a chance to follow and join.  Then return to the home world (or log)

***Special Events***
Angry Raid - If we are having a bad time in a world and get annoyed, we all "die" and return to home world. We all use the military robot avatar with the guns.  Then as we enter we line up one by one and wait. Good pause after we line up. 
Then on command we go with the theatrical battle plan opener, then guns blazing. Attack is no longer then 2 minutes of crazy then we all regroup, line up and vanish.
